        <p>While Carsharing is intended to be an entirely beneficial exercise, all participants should be aware of a number of general terms &amp; conditions:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="text-center">
        <strong>
        By participating and registering, you understand and agree to the general terms and conditions below:
        </strong>
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        
        <li>For the purposes of this website, 'Carsharing' is the term used to denote sharing a journey(s) by car. Carsharers can be both seeking or offering lifts or both. Carsharing is also referred to as 'lift-sharing', 'car-pooling' or 'ride-sharing'.</li><br>
        <li>Carsharing is strictly voluntary and you are under no obligation of any kind whatsoever to participate in this scheme.</li><br>
        <li>All participating parties are entitled to decline the offer of a lift or to terminate a Carsharing arrangement for any reason without quibble, consequence or complaint from their colleagues and/or other Carsharing participants.</li><br>
        <li>When it comes to sharing journeys, every member is responsible for their own personal safety. However we do recommend that you read some simple safety measures outlined on this website.
        Good etiquette is required of all participants including polite and friendly behaviour and punctuality for agreed appointments.</li><br>
        <li>All participants agree to inform their fellow participants as far in advance as possible of any cancellation of a lift, inability to provide or to attend for a lift, or any other interruption to the arrangements agreed between the participants.</li><br>
        <li>Carsharing participants are advised to agree between them procedures for mutually acceptable waiting periods in the event of a participating colleague not showing up either to provide or to take a lift.</li><br>
        <li>All participating drivers agree to provide lifts on a strictly not for profit basis. If an insured person who is going to take part in a car sharing group has any doubt about their insurance cover, they should clarify same with their insurer.</li><br>    
        <li>On registration into the system, all participant details are stored securely in the database and only the details required to organise a Carshare are displayed on-line. Details provided are not used for any other purpose whatsoever.</li><br>
